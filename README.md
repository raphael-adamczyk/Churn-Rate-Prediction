# Churn-Rate-Prediction
Develop a scoring model to identify churners in a retail bank (Python and R)

Our client, a retail bank, wishes to address the problem of customer churn.

- The aim is to produce a system to generate a churn score to provide advisers with a list of customers to treat as a priority. 
- Bank advisors, when they receive a customer to treat, would also like to understand the reasons that lead them to leave the bank in order to adapt their sales pitch
- The bank is divided into 6 branches, whose customer handling processes and sales approaches may vary.
